# Wayonara - Front-end technical test

Hi! Thanks for your interest in Wayonara!  
You have a week (this is a soft limit) to write a simple single-page application (requirements below) and show us why you'd be a great fit for our team.

If you need more time, just let us know.

## What are we looking for?

We are interested in how you write code and how you choose to solve problems: fairly obvious things.  
But we will also look at your organizational skills, precision, taste for design, and strategic vision.

Just try to be your best developer-self. This is your chance to impress us!

## How to submit your work

Use this repository and work as you would normally do.

The `master` branch has been protected, so you will have to open a pull-request for your work. Please do it as soon as you start, so that we can follow along as you proceed.

When you are done, let us know.  
We then may - or may not - need you to clarify some doubts or make some modifications. We would do that by using the code review features GitHub has on the pull-requests, just like we do every day at work.

After that, we will take a couple days to complete the review of your application and get back to you.

## The application

### Technology
Angular 4 preferred, with component-driven AngularJS > 1.5 as a second choice. If you don't know either of them, you can choose any other JavaScript framework or library.

Bootstrap 3.3.7 is the preferred - but not mandatory - choice for the CSS part.

Use English as the main language of the application.

Use JSON files to simulate a REST back-end.

### Theme
A personal restaurant review application, to help choosing where to go for our end-of-sprint celebration lunch.

As a user, I want to view the master list of restaurants, and I want to add a new restaurant.

The minimum required properties of a restaurant will be: name, description, address.

As a user, I want to reorder the master list by name and filter / search by name, description, address.

Anything not specified here, you can ask by commenting in the pull-request and / or invent (if you need answers and can't wait, let us know via skype / telephone / email and we will reply to your comment in the pull-request as soon as possible).

### Bonus points
*(choose as many as you want, if you want, in the order you prefer)*

- Write unit tests (any framework. Karma + Jasmine preferred)
- Write end-to-end tests with Protractor
- Use a CSS pre-processor (Sass preferred)
- Add a user management with multiple users (no need to implement a user sign up)
- Add the ability to like or dislike a restaurant
- Add the ability to tag a restaurant (something like: pizza, family friendly, mexican, pet friendly, spicy food)
- Add i18n support and translate the application to italian
- Add avatar image, bio, and profile page to the users 
- Produce UX mockups / wireframes of what you are going to implement
- Implement a better back-end using a node.js based framework (Sails.js, Trails.js, ...) or a custom node.js application
